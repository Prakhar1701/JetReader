# JetReader

The “JetReader” project is an Android application designed to provide users
with a platform for managing their reading lists. With “JetReader”, users can
create an account, log in, and search for books that they can add to their
reading list. The application also provides users with the ability to rate the
books they have read and mark them as completed, which is then displayed on
their personal statistics screen.
